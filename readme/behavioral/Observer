Comparison With Other Similar Design Patterns
->Chain of Responsibility, Command, Mediator, and Observer are all methods for decoupling senders and
receivers, but each has its own set of trade-offs.
->A sender request is passed through a chain of possible receivers using the Chain of Responsibility
-> A sender-receiver relationship with a subclass is generally specified by the command pattern.
->In Mediator, senders and receivers make implicit references to one another.
->Observer pattern offers a decoupled interface that enables the configuration of numerous receivers at the time of execution.
The observer pattern and the mediator pattern are very similar. The distinction is because an Observer object spreads
communication among objects by incorporating observer and subject objects, but a Mediator object encapsulates interaction
among different objects.

.A publisher object uses the observer pattern to send information to subscriber objects.
The proxy pattern, on the other hand, is used to wrap a type of special object with one or several different objects.

| ðŸ”„ **Decoupling object creation from usage**      | Clients don't need to know how objects are created, only how to use them.       |
| ðŸ§° **When object creation is complex**            | If creating an object involves many steps or configurations.                    |
| ðŸ§© **Multiple implementations of an interface**   | Choose which implementation to return at runtime based on input or environment. |
| ðŸ”§ **When classes are decided at runtime**        | Useful in plugin systems, configuration-based setups, or strategy selection.    |
| ðŸš€ **Improving code maintainability and testing** | Replaces `new` keyword with factories, making mocking and testing easier.       |



Real example
1. Used in notification system where notification type SMS, EMAIL , whatsApp
